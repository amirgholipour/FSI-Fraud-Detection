# Step 4: FSI Credit Fraud Detection

Now that you know how the environment works, the real work can begin!

Please go to the notebook folder, then  just open the file `02_FSI-Fraud-Detection-Workshop.ipynb`, and follow the instructions directly in the notebook!

This one stop notebook covers all steps of a data science modeling! From developing the AI/ML solution, to deploying the solution via containers and then testing the application!

Please Run the notebook!

This notebook starts with presenting some head of the data, then plot the distribution and correlation among various features.

After that, it defines the model and train and test it via validation data!

At the end of the training/testing, it will start to deploy the model:

Finally, at the end of this notebook, it tests the application via passing the new data!
